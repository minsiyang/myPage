    <!-- About Me -->
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a full-stack junior developer, recently graduated from the Makers Academy coding 
      bootcamp in London. I am looking to join a team where I can consolidate and expand my 
      programming knowledge. 

      Being a creative individual, and having seen how the music industry could benefit from 
      having a closer and broader relationship with modern technology, I decided to take the 
      plunge to join the 16-week Makers Academy bootcamp after spending 20 years playing music 
      with many orchestras and ensembles around the world. 
      
      I consider myself an energetic and outgoing person, with a real passion for learning new 
      technology and an interest in problem solving. Collaborating with and meeting people from 
      diverse cultures, age groups and backgrounds was one of the key elements of my previous 
      work experience, which I would love to bring to my new work environment. I am eager to work 
      in a supportive and diverse environment.
